# Asset Tracking System
Sample info here

### Install
1. To use it just clone the repo and composer install.
2. Set the database connection
3. To test the app run `php artisan db:seed`, our [interactive seeder](http://www.qcode.in/advance-interactive-database-seeding-in-laravel/) will take care of everything.

### Add a new Resource
1. Create desired resource by running 
 ```bash
## Create Asset model with migration and resource controller
php artisan make:model Asset -mcr
```
2. Register route for it.
```php
Route::group( ['middleware' => ['auth']], function() {
    ...
    Route::resource('assets', 'AssetController');
});
```

3. Now implement your controllers methods and use the `Authorizable` trait
```php
use App\Authorizable;

class AssetController extends Controller
{
    use Authorizable;
    ...
```

4. Now add the permissions for this new `Asset` model.
```bash
php artisan auth:permission Asset
```

That's it, you have added new resource controller which have full access control by laravel permissions.
 
 ### auth:permission command
 This command can be user to add or remove permission for a given model
 
 ```bash
## add permission
php artisan auth:permission Asset

## remove permissions
php artisan auth:permission Asset --remove
```
